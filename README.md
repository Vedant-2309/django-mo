# django-mo

Quick intro for every command ive ran

```
virtualenc -v python -p python3.13
```

This command initialises the venv which is necessary for development 

```
pip3 install django
```

```
django-admin startproject myProject
```
This creates the main project folder

```
source bin/activate
```
this runs the venv

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
and this command, finally ran the server which allowed me to access the site on port 8000
